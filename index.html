            Food and Flavors of India
            <p> Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian
                subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these
                cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food
                is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. </p>
            <p2> Lets explore the pattern of tastebuds across the country</p2>

                <p> India’s population is highly diverse, with cultural identities heavily influenced by religious and
                    regional particularities. Ayurvedic teachings, emphasizing equilibrium between mind, body, and
                    spirit, have
                    exerted an influence over Indian cuisine in general, dictating ingredient pairings and cooking
                    practices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Approximately one-third of India’s population is vegetarian, dictated by their Hindu, Jain, or
                    Buddhist faiths. For example, Hindu followers abstain from beef, because cattle are sacred in this
                    faith.
                    Depending on the dominant religious beliefs of a region, the cuisine in a particular area may omit
                    certain
                    ingredients to comply with religious law. </p>

                Dishes made in the North-East usually require a very low cooking time, because they are steamed,
                with minimal use of spices, and more use of vegetables or meat. </li>

                dishes that need very
                less prepartion time, but its flavor is enhanced by cooking it on low flame for hours. </li>

            <li> The grouped bar-chart shows which type of meal is really dominant in each of these states.
                <b>Punjab</b> stands top on main course, and is very famous as well. Any "North-indian" food that we get
                in
                famous restaurants is typically originated from Punjab and its nearby states in the North.
                North Indian cuisine uses a lot of <b>Dairy</b> - Paneer (cottage cheese), malai (cream), and
                ghee(clarified
                butter). </li>
            <li> <b>Gujarat</b> is known for fast food, and delicious snacks, and hence stands highest in the list. The
                locals
                of Gujarat are huge foodies and tend to innovate snack items with every possible ingredient!
                Some of the <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/most-popular-snacks-in-gujarat">famous snacks in
                    Gujarat</a> are Dhokla, Khandvi, Khakra, Patra, Jalebi & Faafda. </li>
            <li> <b>West Bengal</b> stands high on dessert. They are well-known for "Mithai's" - these are a variety of
                dry-fruit sweets and sweets like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasgulla">Rasgullas</a> & <a

        <ul>
            <li> Similar to most cuisines, cooking time for vegetarian dishes is much higher than non-vegetarian dishes.
            </li>
            <li> North and West regions of India make spicy main courses and snacks that take the maximum time, while
                South indian dishes like the Biryani,
                take the most time in the Non-vegetarian category.</li>
            <li> It is interesting to note that North-eastern food in India are hardly vegetarian (atleast from our
                data).
                some of the states in the Western region follow Buddhism and Jainism, and follow strict dietary
                restictions - which is
                why they stand least within the Non-vegetarian category.
